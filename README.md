# Portfolio Website

This is a repository created from a template portfolio webpage repository to test with some of the other Github Student Developer features (Microsoft Azure and some other domain hosting services)

The template link is here: https://github.com/education/codespaces-project-template-js

My portfolio website will be deployed at: https://www.hleitr.me

# Skills acquired through this webpage

I have managed to read JavaScript code throughout this whole project, and also incorporated my own part into it. 

I have also modified some CSS Elements to make the webpage look a little bit more interesting. 

Also, I realized a few small bugs within the template, which I have already issued. 

Lastly, I have also learned a little bit of React, it seems pretty fun, as it updates almost immediately.
